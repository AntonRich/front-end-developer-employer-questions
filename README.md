front-end-developer-employer-questions
======================================

A list of questions you can ask potential employers, when 
interviewing for a front-end development position.

The Front-end Job Interview Questions list is pretty 
awesome - is there such a list to ask employers?

Offhand, I can think of the following:
 
<strong>General Questions:</strong>
- How do you define front end development?
- 

<strong>Project Management:</strong>
- Do you have dedicated project managers?
- If so, how many, and how are they certified?
- What is your development methodology?
If Agile:
  . What is your sprint length?
  . How often to you push code live?
- How do you organize project teams?
- What is an average project size in terms of days/weeks/team members?

<strong>QA:</strong>
- Do you have any dedicated QA software or hardware?
- How do you determine browsers/devices for testing?
- Do you have metrics on site visitor user agents?
- Roughly speaking, what percentage of a build is dedicated to QA?
- At what point in the built do you begin QA?
  (bonus for continuous or unit testing)
